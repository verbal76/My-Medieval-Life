# Owner decisions

Generated from `docs/requirements/requirements.json` by `python3 tools/check_requirements.py --write`. Do not edit: change the register (`tools/requirements_update.py`) and regenerate.

The decision register is the `decision` records of the register. A recommendation is never an approval; PROVISIONAL is not final; an approved decision states design intent and may be revisited by the owner when evidence shows unintended consequences (SCHEMA.md, change control).

| ID-D3 | Identity gate baseline: approve the candidate new baseline (docs/design/IDENTITY_GATE_CANDIDATE.json)? Its only divergences (day 13 on both seeds) come from arrivals keeping their permanent band id, which changes traits Build 18 hashes from the id (chapel piety, caravan taste, skill seed, willingness, sprite). Alternatively those traits could be seeded from a stored per-person seed so they no longer depend on the id value (a design change). | PROVISIONAL | no |  | docs/directives/2026-10-23_id_d2_succession_decisions.md |
